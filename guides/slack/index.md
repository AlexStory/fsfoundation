## Functional Programming Slack Team

To get an invite to the [Functional Programming
Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/) team visit
[fpchat.com](http://fpchat.com). An invitation will be sent to the email
address you supply. Follow the instructions to join the Functional
Programming Slack team.

There are currently two F# related channels in the Functional Programming Slack:

* [#fsharp](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/?redir=/archives/fsharp) - This is the general channel for F#. The developers of [Visual F# Power Tools](https://fsprojects.github.io/VisualFSharpPowerTools/), [Xamarin Studio](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview/), [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), [SqlProvider](http://fsprojects.github.io/SQLProvider/), among others all hang out here and are very active. The channel can be wildly off-topic for hours at a time but specific F# questions are usually answered fairly quickly.

* [#fsharp-beginners](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/archives/fsharp-beginners) - Since the main F# channel can be a bit overwhelming, this channel was created to be more friendly for those new to F#.

Other channels that may be of interest include: #haskell, #haskell-beginners, #categorytheory, and #scala.
