headline: Using F# for Data Science

Data science brings techinques such as statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization and programming to 
real-world data sources to bring understanding and insight to data-oriented problem domains.

F# is an excellent solution for programmatic data science as it combines efficient execution
with powerful libraries and scalable data integration. [Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org/learn) has sections specific to data science. 

### Base Technologies

* [Maths and Statistics](/math) packages.
* [Data Access](/data-access) packages.
* [Data Charting and Visualization](/data-visualization) packages.

### Machine Learning

To apply machine learning techniques to your data sets, see the [Machine Learning](/machine-learning) section.

### R, MATLAB, Mathematica and Python Integration

F# can integrate with systems such as R, MATLAB, Mathematica and Python. Some specific resources are:

 * [R Type Provider for F#](https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider) - An F# type provider for higher-fidelity integration between F# and R
 * [MATLAB Type Provider for F#](http://bayardrock.github.io/Matlab-Type-Provider/) - An F# type provider for higher-fidelity integration between F# and MATLAB
 * [Python for .NET](http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/readme.html) - Allows Python to be integrated into F# and C# programs
 * [Integrating MATLAB with F# and C#](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12987) - techniques to call MATLAB from C#, F# and other .NET languages
 * [Calling Mathematica from F#](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/NETLink/tutorial/CallingMathematicaFromNET.html) - techniques to call Mathematics from C#, F# and other .NET languages
 
Many other resources are available for integrating F#, C# and .NET with these systems. If a resource specific
to F# can't be found, then search for C# instead and adjust the technique appropriately.

### Big Data and Big Compute

See the [Cloud Programming](/cloud) section for details 
of scalable data, compute and messaging frameworks and clients for F#. You may need these if working with very large data.
