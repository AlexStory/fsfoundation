**Registration is currently closed. We hope to do another round in the future**

<!--
If you are a member of the FSSF, just complete the [form here](https://fssfedu.typeform.com/to/QZEJEZ) before Sunday 13th March  2016.
The FSSF will then select at random 10 candidates for the initial batch. We will contact you regardless of whether you were selected or not.

There are only a limited number of mentors available right now, so if we are over-subscribed, we will add you to a waiting list.

If you are a successful candidate, you will be contacted by a mentor and together you will decide what you will work on. At the end of 8 weeks the mentorship will end and we will ask for your feedback.


Any questions or comments? get in touch via our twitter account [@fsharpedu](https://twitter.com/fsharpedu)

Thanks for your interest, and hope to hear from you soon!

The F# Software Foundation
